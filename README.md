Therefore, out of respect for the original copyright holders (if any) this repo has no license attached to it. Each game is licensed differently. If you hold the copyright for one of these games and do not want it on this repo then please file an issue and we can remove it.

The JustStudy CE Team do not gain any revenue from JustStudy CE or any of it's games. We do this in our free time. **ALL THE GAMES HERE CAN BE OBTAINED FREE OF CHARGE FROM OFFICIAL STOREFRONTS, VENDORS AND/OR DEVS, WE ARE NOT PROVIDING PAID GAMES FOR FREE BECAUSE ALL THE GAMES HERE ARE FREE ANYWAY.**
